interduction ='''1. The game is played on a grid thatâ€™s 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. Players take turns putting their marks (O or X) in empty squares by typing in the number according to the template below.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
